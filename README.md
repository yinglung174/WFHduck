Working from home requires the staff to set up their working environment at home. Some staff with no IT knowledge may meet some technical problems and they would like to find an IT department in their company or a traditional IT support company for assistance. However, these solutions are not enough to support them because of the slower time and limited support. Therefore, my objective for the project is to develop an online ordering platform to solve the above problem. Not only can it benefit the staff with no IT knowledge, but also it brings a significant advantage to graduate students studying computer science. The methods for the project are to conduct development and testing for a web-based system. After that, the system is released to the public for trial. The questionnaires are conducted to collect their feedback after using the system. Finally, the collected data is analyzed. For the results, over 80% of participants think the system is useful and brings benefits to them. However, some participants provide additional feedback in the questionnaires about further improvements to the system.
